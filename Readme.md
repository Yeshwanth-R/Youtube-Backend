## Backend YouTube Project

In this project, we will be building a robust backend for a YouTube-like application. Our goal is to create a scalable and efficient system that can handle millions of videos, users, and interactions.

Key features of our backend include:

1. User authentication and authorization
2. Video uploading and storage
3. Video metadata management (title, description, tags, etc.)

4. Video playback and streaming
5. Commenting and engagement features
6. Analytics and insights for video creators

Let's get started and create an amazing YouTube-like experience for our users!
